#### /ask How would I get this to work with Ollama? Most open source projects that depend on LLM chat completions have an option to use a custom openai base url in an env file so i can easily enter the ollama local endpoint, but I don't see an option for that in this.

To get this to work with Ollama, you'll need to find a way to redirect the API calls from the OpenAI endpoint to your local Ollama endpoint. Since the project doesn't support a custom OpenAI base URL out of the box, you have a few options:

1. **Modify the code**: Find where the OpenAI API URL is defined in the code and change it to your local Ollama endpoint. This might be in a configuration file or hardcoded in a source file.

2. **Use an API proxy**: Set up a local proxy server that redirects calls from the OpenAI endpoint to your Ollama endpoint. This way, you don't have to modify the original code. You can use tools like `mitmproxy`, `ngrok`, or `localtunnel` for this.

3. **Environment variable injection**: If the project reads the OpenAI API URL from an environment variable, you can set this environment variable to your Ollama endpoint before running the project.

4. **Dependency injection**: If the project uses a dependency injection framework, you can inject your own API service that uses the Ollama endpoint.

Without seeing the full contents of the files, I can't provide a more specific solution. However, these general approaches should help you get started. If you can share more details or specific parts of the code, I can provide more targeted assistance.

#### Can you help me modify this to work with Ollama? The instructions and env setup dont have an option for a custom   
####  openai base url like most of these open source projects that rely on LLM api calls  

To modify the code to work with Ollama, we need to add a configuration option for a custom OpenAI base URL. This will allow you to specify the Ollama local endpoint. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Update the `.env.local` file** to include a new environment variable for the custom OpenAI base URL.
2. **Update the `config.ini` file** to include a new option for the custom OpenAI base URL.
3. **Modify the code** to read this new configuration option and use it for API calls.

Let's start with the `.env.local` file:

.env.local
```
# Define the OpenAI API key here if you want to use a local .env file for that.
OPENAI_API_KEY=....
OPENAI_API_BASE=http://localhost:11434
```

Next, update the `config.ini` file to include a new option for the custom OpenAI base URL:

tinytroupe\config.ini
```
[OpenAI]
#
# OpenAI or Azure OpenAI Service
#

# Default options: openai, azure
API_TYPE=openai

# Check Azure's documentation for updates here:
# https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/chatgpt-quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-python

RAI_COPYRIGHT_INFRINGEMENT_PREVENTION=True

[Logging]
LOGLEVEL=ERROR
# ERROR
# WARNING
# INFO
# DEBUG
```

Finally, you need to modify the code to read this new configuration option and use it for API calls. Since the code for making API calls is not provided, I'll assume you have a function or class that handles API requests. You need to modify this part of the code to use the custom OpenAI base URL if it is provided.

Here's an example of how you might modify the code to read the custom OpenAI base URL from the configuration:

tinytroupe\api_client.py
```
import os
import configparser

class APIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        self.config.read('tinytroupe/config.ini')
        self.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
        self.api_base = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_BASE', self.config['OpenAI']['OPENAI_API_BASE'])

    def make_request(self, endpoint, data):
        url = f"{self.api_base}/{endpoint}"
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()
```

In this example, the `APIClient` class reads the `OPENAI_API_BASE` from the environment variables or the configuration file and uses it to construct the API request URL.

Please adjust the code according to your actual implementation. If you provide more details or specific parts of the code, I can give more targeted assistance.

The error indicates that the `requests` module is not imported in the `api_client.py` file. To fix this, you need to import the `requests` module at the beginning of the file.

Here is the updated `api_client.py` file with the necessary import statement:

tinytroupe\api_client.py
```
import os
import configparser
import requests

class APIClient:
    def __init__(self):
        self.config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        self.config.read('tinytroupe/config.ini')
        self.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
        self.api_base = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_BASE', self.config['OpenAI']['OPENAI_API_BASE'])

    def make_request(self, endpoint, data):
        url = f"{self.api_base}/{endpoint}"
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
        return response.json()

# TinyTroupe 🤠🤓🥸🧐
*LLM-powered multiagent persona simulation for imagination enhancement and business insights.*

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/tinytroupe_stage.png" alt="A tiny office with tiny people doing some tiny jobs.">
</p>

*TinyTroupe* is an experimental Python library that allows the **simulation** of people with specific personalities, interests, and goals. These artificial agents - `TinyPerson`s - can listen to us and one another, reply back, and go about their lives in simulated `TinyWorld` environments. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, to generate realistic simulated behavior. This allow us to investigate a wide range of **convincing interactions** and **consumer types**, with **highly customizable personas**, under **conditions of our choosing**. The focus is thus on *understanding* human behavior and not on directly *supporting it* (like, say, AI assistants do) -- this results in, among other things, specialized mechanisms that make sense only in a simulation setting. Further, unlike other *game-like* LLM-based simulation approaches, TinyTroupe aims at enlightening productivity and business scenarios, thereby contributing to more successful projects and products. Here are some application ideas to **enhance human imagination**:

  - **Advertisement:** TinyTroupe can **evaluate digital ads (e.g., Bing Ads)** offline with a simulated audience before spending money on them!
  - **Software Testing:** TinyTroupe can **provide test input** to systems (e.g., search engines, chatbots or copilots) and then **evaluate the results**.
  - **Training and exploratory data:** TinyTroupe can generate realistic **synthetic data** that can be later used to train models or be subject to opportunity analyses.
  - **Product and project management:** TinyTroupe can **read project or product proposals** and **give feedback** from the perspective of **specific personas** (e.g., physicians, lawyers, and knowledge workers in general).
  - **Brainstorming:** TinyTroupe can simulate **focus groups** and deliver great product feedback at a fraction of the cost!

In all of the above, and many others, we hope experimenters can **gain insights** about their domain of interest, and thus make better decisions.

We are releasing *TinyTroupe* at a relativelly early stage, with considerable work still to be done, because we are looking for feedback and contributions to steer development in productive directions. We are particularly interested in finding new potential use cases, for instance in specific industries.

>[!NOTE]
>🚧 **WORK IN PROGRESS: expect frequent changes**.
>TinyTroupe is an ongoing research project, still under **very significant development** and requiring further **tidying up**. In particular, the API is still subject to frequent changes. Experimenting with API variations is essential to shape it correctly, but we are working to stabilize it and provide a more consistent and friendly experience over time. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to improve the library.

>[!CAUTION]
>⚖️ **Read the LEGAL DISCLAIMER.**
>TinyTroupe is for research and simulation only. You are fully responsible for any use you make of the generated outputs. Various important additional legal considerations apply and constrain its use, please read the full [Legal Disclaimer](#legal-disclaimer) section below before using TinyTroupe.

## Examples

To get a sense of what TinyTroupe can do, here are some examples of its use. These examples are available in the [examples/](./examples/) folder, and you can either inspect the pre-compiled Jupyter notebooks or run them yourself locally. Notice the interactive nature of TinyTroupe experiments -- just like you use Jupyter notebooks to interact with data, you can use TinyTroupe to interact with simulated people and environments, for the purpose of gaining insights.

>[!NOTE]
> Currently, simulation outputs are better visualized against dark backgrounds, so we recommend using a dark theme in your Jupyter notebook client.

### 🧪**Example 1** *(from [interview_with_customer.ipynb](./examples/interview_with_customer.ipynb))*
Let's begin with a simple customer interview scenario, where a business consultant approaches a banker:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-1.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

The conversation can go on for a few steps to dig deeper and deeper until the consultant is satisfied with the information gathered, for instance a concrete project idea:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_customer-interview-2.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

### 🧪**EXAMPLE 2** *(from [advertisement_for_tv.ipynb](./examples/advertisement_for_tv.ipynb))*
Let's evaluate some online ads options to pick the best one. Here's one example output for TV ad evaluation:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_tv-ad-1.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

Now, instead of having to carefully read what the agents said, we can extract the choice of each agent and compute the overall preference in an automated manner:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_tv-ad-2.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

### 🧪 **EXAMPLES 3** *(from [product_brainstorming.ipynb](./examples/product_brainstorming.ipynb))*
And here's a focus group starting to brainstorm about new AI features for Microsoft Word. Instead of interacting with each agent individually, we manipulate the environment to make them interact with each other:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_brainstorming-1.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

After running a simulation, we can extract the results in a machine-readable manner, to reuse elsewhere (e.g., a report generator); here's what we get for the above brainstorming session:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/example_screenshot_brainstorming-2.png" alt="An example.">
</p>

You can find other examples in the [examples/](./examples/) folder.

## Pre-requisites

To run the library, you need:
  - Python 3.10 or higher. We'll assume you are using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), but you can use other Python distributions.
  - Access to Azure OpenAI Service, OpenAI GPT-4 APIs, or Ollama. You can get access to the Azure OpenAI Service [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service), and to the OpenAI API [here](https://platform.openai.com/). For Ollama, you can follow the instructions [here](https://ollama.com/).
      * For Azure OpenAI Service, you will need to set the `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY` and `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` environment variables to your API key and endpoint, respectively.
      * For OpenAI, you will need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key.
      * For Ollama, you will need to set the `OPENAI_API_BASE` environment variable to your API base URL.
  - By default, TinyTroupe `config.ini` is set to use some specific API, model and related parameters. You can customize these values by including your own `config.ini` file in the same folder as the program or notebook you are running. An example of a `config.ini` file is provided in the [examples/](./examples/) folder.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Content Filters**: To ensure no harmful content is generated during simulations, it is strongly recommended to use content filters whenever available at the API level. In particular, **if using Azure OpenAI, there's extensive support for content moderation, and we urge you to use it.** For details about how to do so, please consult [the corresponding Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-filter). If content filters are in place, and an API call is rejected by them, the library will raise an exception, as it will be unable to proceed with the simulation at that point.

## Installation

**Currently, the officially recommended way to install the library is directly from this repository, not PyPI.** You can follow these steps:

1. If Conda is not installed, you can get it from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). You can also use other Python distributions, but we'll assume Conda here for simplicity.
2. Create a new Python environment:
      ```bash
      conda create -n tinytroupe python=3.10
      ```
3. Activate the environment:
      ```bash
      conda activate tinytroupe
      ```
4. Make sure you have either Azure OpenAI, OpenAI API keys, or Ollama set as environment variables, as described in the [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites) section.
5. Clone the repository, as we'll perform a local install (we **will not install from PyPI**):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe
    cd tinytroupe
    ```

6. Install the library **from this repository, not PyPI**:
      ```bash
      pip install .
      ```
7. You can now run the examples in the [examples/](./examples/) folder or use TinyTroupe to create your simulations 🥳. If you want to run the examples in the
   [examples/](./examples/) folder or modify TinyTroupe itself, however, you should clone the repository as described below.

### Local development

If you want to modify TinyTroupe itself, you can install it in editable mode (i.e., changes to the code will be reflected immediately):
```bash
pip install -e .

Recently, we have seen LLMs used to simulate people (such as [this](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents)), but largely in a “game-like” setting for contemplative or entertainment purposes. There are also libraries for building multiagent systems for proble-solving and assitive AI, like [Autogen](https://microsoft.github.io/) and [Crew AI](https://docs.crewai.com/). What if we combine these ideas and simulate people to support productivity tasks? TinyTroupe is our attempt. To do so, it follows these principles:

  1. **Programmatic**: agents and environments are defined programmatically (in Python and JSON), allowing very flexible uses. They can also thus underpin other software apps!
  2. **Analytical**: meant to improve our understanding of people, users and society. Unlike entertainment applications, this is one aspect that is critical for business and productivity use cases. This is also why we recommend using Jupyter notebooks for simulations, just like one uses them for data analysis.
  3. **Persona-based**: agents are meant to be archetypical representation of people; for greater realism and control, detailed specification of such personas is encouraged: age, occupation, skills, tastes, opinions, etc.
  4. **Multiagent**: allows multiagent interaction under well-defined environmental constraints.
  5. **Utilities-heavy**: provides many mechanisms to facilitate specifications, simulations, extractions, reports, validations, etc. This is one area in which dealing with *simulations* differs significantly from *assistance* tools.
  6. **Experiment-oriented**: simulations are defined, run, analyzed and refined by an *experimenter* iteratively; suitable experimentation tools are thus provided. *See one of our [previous paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/the-case-for-experiment-oriented-computing/) for more on this.*

Together, these are meant to make TinyTroupe a powerful and flexible **imagination enhancement tool** for business and productivity scenarios.

### Assistants vs. Simulators

One common source of confusion is to think all such AI agents are meant for assiting humans. How narrow, fellow homosapiens! Have you not considered that perhaps we can simulate artificial people to understand real people? Truly, this is our aim here -- TinyTroup is meant to simulate and help understand people! To further clarify this point, consider the following differences:

|   Meanwhile, help users accomplish tasks     |   Meanwhile, help users understand other people and users – it is a “toolbox”! |

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
  - `/tinytroupe`: contains the Python library itself. In particular:
    * `/tinytroupe/prompts`  contains the prompts used to call the LLMs.
  - `/tests`: contains the unit tests for the library. You can use the `test.bat` script to run these.
  - `/examples`: contains examples that show how to use the library, mainly using Jupyter notebooks (for greater readability), but also as pure Python scripts.
  - `/data`: any data used by the examples or the library.
  - `/docs`: documentation for the project.

## Using the Library

As any multiagent system, TinyTroupe provides two key abstractions:
  - `TinyPerson`, the *agents* that have personality, receive stimuli and act upon them.
  - `TinyWorld`, the *environment* in which the agents exist and interact.

Various parameters can also be customized in the `config.ini` file, notably the API type (Azure OpenAI Service or OpenAI API), the model parameters, and the logging level.

Let's see some examples of how to use these and also learn about other mechanisms available in the library.

### TinyPerson

A `TinyPerson` is a simulated person with specific personality traits, interests, and goals. As each such simulated agent progresses through its life, it receives stimuli from the environment and acts upon them. The stimuli are received through the `listen`, `see` and other similar methods, and the actions are performed through the `act` method. Convenience methods like `listen_and_act` are also provided.

Each such agent contains a lot of unique details, which is the source of its realistic behavior. This, however, means that it takes significant effort to specify an agent manually. Hence, for convenience, `TinyTroupe` provide some easier ways to get started or generate new agents.

To begin with, `tinytroupe.examples` contains some pre-defined agent builders that you can use. For example, `tinytroupe.examples.create_lisa_the_data_scientist` creates a `TinyPerson` that represents a data scientist called Lisa. You can use it as follows:

```python
from tinytroupe.examples import create_lisa_the_data_scientist

lisa = create_lisa_the_data_scientist() # instantiate a Lisa from the example builder
lisa.listen_and_act("Tell me about your life.")
```

To see how to define your own agents from scratch, you can check Lisa's source, which contains elements like these:

```python
lisa = TinyPerson("Lisa")

lisa.define("age", 28)
lisa.define("nationality", "Canadian")
lisa.define("occupation", "Data Scientist")

lisa.define("routine", "Every morning, you wake up, do some yoga, and check your emails.", group="routines")
lisa.define("occupation_description",
              """
              You are a data scientist. You work at Microsoft, (...)
              """)

lisa.define_several("personality_traits",
                      [
                          {"trait": "You are curious and love to learn new things."},
                          {"trait": "You are analytical and like to solve problems."},
                          {"trait": "You are friendly and enjoy working with others."},
                          {"trait": "You don't give up easily, and always try to find a solution. However, sometimes you can get frustrated when things don't work as expected."}
                      ])

```

`TinyTroupe` also provides a clever way to obtain new agents, using LLMs to generate their specification for you, through the `TinyPersonFactory` class.

```python
from tinytroupe.factory import TinyPersonFactory

factory = TinyPersonFactory("A hospital in São Paulo.")
person = factory.generate_person("Create a Brazilian person that is a doctor, like pets and the nature and love heavy metal.")
```

### TinyWorld

`TinyWorld` is the base class for environments. Here's an example of conversation between Lisa, the data scientist, and Oscar, the architect. The
program is defined as follows:

```python
world = TinyWorld("Chat Room", [lisa, oscar])
world.make_everyone_accessible()
lisa.listen("Talk to Oscar to know more about him")
world.run(4)
```

This produces the following conversation:

```text
USER --> Lisa: [CONVERSATION]
          > Talk to Oscar to know more about him
────────────────────────────────────────────── Chat Room step 1 of 4 ──────────────────────────────────────────────
Lisa --> Lisa: [THOUGHT]
          > I will now act a bit, and then issue DONE.
Lisa acts: [TALK]
          > Hi Oscar, I'd love to know more about you. Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Lisa --> Lisa: [THOUGHT]
          > I will now act a bit, and then issue DONE.
Lisa acts: [DONE]

Lisa --> Oscar: [CONVERSATION]
          > Hi Oscar, I'd love to know more about you. Could you tell me a bit about yourself?
Oscar --> Oscar: [THOUGHT]
           > I will now act a bit, and then issue DONE.
Oscar acts: [TALK]
           > Hi Lisa! Sure, I'd be happy to share a bit about myself. I'm Oscar, a 30-year-old
           > architect from Germany. I work at a company called Awesome Inc., where I focus on
           > designing standard elements for new apartment buildings. I love modernist architecture,
           > new technologies, and sustainable practices. In my free time, I enjoy traveling to
           > exotic places, playing the guitar, and reading science fiction books. How about you?
Oscar --> Oscar: [THOUGHT]
           > I will now act a bit, and then issue DONE.
Oscar acts: [DONE]

Oscar --> Lisa: [CONVERSATION]
           > Hi Lisa! Sure, I'd be happy to share a bit about myself. I'm Oscar, a 30-year-old
           > architect from Germany. I work at a company called Awesome Inc., where I focus on
           > designing standard elements for new apartment buildings. I love modernist architecture,
           > new technologies, and sustainable practices. In my free time, I enjoy traveling to
           > exotic places, playing the guitar, and reading science fiction books. How about you?
```

`TinyWorld` enforces very little constraints on the possible interactions. Subclasses, however, are supposed to provide more strucutred environments.

### Utilities

TinyTroupe provides a number of utilities and conveniences to help you create simulations and derive value from them. These include:

  - `TinyPersonFactory`: helps you generate new `TinyPerson`s using LLMs.
  - `TinyTool`: simulated tools that can be used by `TinyPerson`s.
  - `TinyStory`: helps you create and manage the story told through simulations.
  - `TinyPersonValidator`: helps you validate the behavior of your `TinyPerson`s.
  - `ResultsExtractor` and `ResultsReducer`: extract and reduce the results of interactions between agents.
  - ... and more ...

In general, elements that represent simulated entities or complementary mechanisms are prefixed with `Tiny`, while those that are more infrastructural are not. This is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.

### Caching
Calling LLM APIs can be expensive, thus caching strategies are important to help reduce that cost.
TinyTroupe comes with two such mechanisms: one for the simulation state, another for the LLM calls themselves.

#### Caching Simulation State

Imagine you have a scenario with 10 different steps, you've worked hard in 9 steps, and now you are
just tweaking the 10th step. To properly validate your modifications, you need to rerun the whole
simulation of course. However, what's the point in re-executing the first 9, and incur the LLM cost, when you are
already satisified with them and did not modify them? For situations like this, the module `tinytroupe.control`
provide useful simulation management methods:

  - `control.begin("<CACHE_FILE_NAME>.cache.json")`: begins recording the state changes of a simulation, to be saved to
    the specified file on disk.
  - `control.checkpoint()`: saves the simulation state at this point.
  - `control.end()`: terminates the simulation recording scope that had be started by `control.begin()`.

#### Caching LLM API Calls

This is enabled preferably in the `config.ini` file, and alternativelly via the `openai_utils.force_api_cache()`.

LLM API caching, when enabled, works at a lower and simpler level than simulation state caching. Here,
what happens is a very straightforward: every LLM call is kept in a map from the input to the generated output;
when a new call comes and is identical to a previous one, the cached value is returned.

### Config.ini

The `config.ini` file contains various parameters that can be used to customize the behavior of the library, such as model parameters and logging level. Please pay special attention to `API_TYPE` parameter, which defines whether you are using the Azure OpenAI Service or the OpenAI API. We provide an example of a `config.ini` file, [./examples/config.ini](./examples/config.ini), which you can use as a template for your own, or just modify to run the examples.

### What and How to Contribute
We need all sorts of things, but we are looking mainly for new interesting use cases demonstrations, or even just domain-specific application ideas. If you are a domain expert in some area that could benefit from TinyTroupe, we'd love to hear from you.

Beyond that, many other aspects can be improved, such as:
  - Memory mechanisms.
  - Data grounding mechanisms.
  - Reasoning mechanisms.
  - New environment types.
  - Interfacing with the external world.
  - ... and more ...

Please note that anything that you contribute might be released as open-source (under MIT license).

If you would like to make a contribution, please try to follow these general guidelines:
  - **Tiny naming convention**: If you are implementing a experimenter-facing simulated element (e.g., an agent or environment type) or closely related (e.g., agent factories, or content enrichers), and it sounds good, call your new *XYZ* as *TinyXYZ* :-) On the other hand, auxiliary and infrastructural mechanisms should not start with the "Tiny" prefix. The idea is to emphasize the simulated nature of the elements that are part of the simulation itself.
  - **Tests:** If you are writing some new mechanism, please also create at least a unit test `tests/unit/`, and if you can a functional scenario test (`tests/scenarios/`).
  - **Demonstrations:** If you'd like to demonstrate a new scenario, please design it preferably as a new Jupyter notebook within `examples/`.
  - **Microsoft:** If you are implementing anything that is Microsoft-specific and non-confidential, please put it under a `.../microsoft/` folder.

*LLM-powered multiagent persona simulation for imagination enhancement and business insights.*

<p align="center">
  <img src="./docs/tinytroupe_stage.png" alt="A tiny office with tiny people doing some tiny jobs.">
</p>

*TinyTroupe* is an experimental Python library that allows the **simulation** of people with specific personalities, interests, and goals. These artificial agents - `TinyPerson`s - can listen to us and one another, reply back, and go about their lives in simulated `TinyWorld` environments. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, to generate realistic simulated behavior. This allow us to investigate a wide range of **convincing interactions** and **consumer types**, with **highly customizable personas**, under **conditions of our choosing**. The focus is thus on *understanding* human behavior and not on directly *supporting it* (like, say, AI assistants do) -- this results in, among other things, specialized mechanisms that make sense only in a simulation setting. Further, unlike other *game-like* LLM-based simulation approaches, TinyTroupe aims at enlightening productivity and business scenarios, thereby contributing to more successful projects and products. Here are some application ideas to **enhance human imagination**:

####  Can u make sure this will work with ollama model names? Sometimes projects like this check if model names are on a list of openai models or not  

To ensure that the project works with Ollama model names, we need to make sure that the model names are not hardcoded or validated against a list of OpenAI models. We will modify the `tinytroupe\api_client.py` file to remove any model name validation that might be present.

Here is the updated `tinytroupe\api_client.py` file:

    def __init__(self):

        self.api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
        self.api_base = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_BASE', self.config['OpenAI']['OPENAI_API_BASE'])

    def make_request(self, endpoint, data):
        url = f"{self.api_base}/{endpoint}"
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)

The error you're encountering is due to the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum not recognizing `'mxbai-embed-large:latest'` as a valid model type. This is likely because the model name is not part of the predefined set of models supported by the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the model name used in the `config.ini` file is compatible with the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum. We can do this by either:

1. Changing the model name in the `config.ini` file to a supported model.
2. Modifying the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum to include the custom model name.

Since we want to ensure compatibility with Ollama, we will opt for the second approach. We will modify the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum to include `'mxbai-embed-large:latest'` as a valid model type.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Modify the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum to include the custom model name.
2. Ensure the `config.ini` file uses the correct model name.

Let's start with the changes to the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum. We need to locate the file where this enum is defined and add the custom model name.

Assuming the enum is defined in a file named `openai_embedding_model_type.py` within the `llama_index` package, here is the updated file:

llama_index\embeddings\openai\openai_embedding_model_type.py
<source>
from enum import Enum

class OpenAIEmbeddingModelType(Enum):
    TEXT_EMBEDDING_ADA_002 = "text-embedding-ada-002"
    TEXT_SIMILARITY_ADA_001 = "text-similarity-ada-001"
    TEXT_SEARCH_ADA_DOC_001 = "text-search-ada-doc-001"
    TEXT_EMBEDDING_3_SMALL = "text-embedding-3-small"
    MXBAI_EMBED_LARGE = "mxbai-embed-large:latest"  # Add the custom model name here
</source>

Next, ensure the `config.ini` file uses the correct model name:

With these changes, the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum will recognize `'mxbai-embed-large:latest'` as a valid model type, and the `config.ini` file will use the correct model name. This should resolve the `ValueError` you encountered.

#### /ask do i need to run 'pip install -e .' again before i re try  

#### do i need to run 'pip install -e .' again before i re try  

No, you do not need to run `pip install -e .` again before retrying. The `pip install -e .` command is used to install the package in editable mode, which means that any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected without needing to reinstall the package.

Since you have already run `pip install -e .`, any changes you make to the source code should be automatically picked up. Therefore, you can simply retry running your script or notebook without needing to reinstall the package.

If you encounter any issues, make sure that your virtual environment is activated and that you are working in the correct directory. If you still face problems, you might want to check if there are any cached files or dependencies that need to be updated, but generally, reinstalling the package should not be necessary.

#### can you please fix the errors in the product brainstorming notebook? you should be able to see the error output  

To fix the errors in the `product_brainstorming.ipynb` notebook, we need to ensure that the model name `'mxbai-embed-large:latest'` is recognized by the `OpenAIEmbeddingModelType` enum. We have already added this model name to the enum in the `llama_index\embeddings\openai\openai_embedding_model_type.py` file. However, we need to make sure that the notebook is using the correct configuration and that the model name is properly referenced.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Ensure that the `config.ini` file in the `examples` directory is correctly set up with the `OPENAI_API_BASE` and `EMBEDDING_MODEL`.
2. Update the `product_brainstorming.ipynb` notebook to handle any potential issues with model name recognition.

Let's start with the `config.ini` file in the `examples` directory:
